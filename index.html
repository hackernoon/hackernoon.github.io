<p><strong>USER TERMS OF SERVICE</strong></p>

<p>Last Updated on [March 12, 2019]</p>

<p><strong>1. Introduction.</strong></p>
<p>This website, www.hackernoon.com, along with any subdomains, translated versions and mobile applications that link to or reference these User Terms of Service ("Site"), is operated by Artmap Inc. ("we", "us", or "Company"), a Colorado corporation with address at PO Box 2206, Edwards, Colorado 81632. These User Terms of Service ("User Terms") govern your access to and your use of the Site. "You" and "your" refer to you, a User of the Site. A "User" is anyone who accesses, browses, crawls, scrapes, contributes or submits Content (defined below) to, or in any way uses the Site.
These User Terms refer to the Medium Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which also applies to your use of the Site and which sets forth the terms on which personal data will be collected from you.</p>

<p><strong>2. Acceptance of the User Terms.</strong></p>
<p>These User Terms are to ensure that you will use the Site only in the ways in which Company intends it to be used, and to make clear what uses Company will not permit, will not be responsible for, or both.
By using the Site, or by clicking to accept or agree to the User Terms when the option is made available to you:
  <ul>
    <li>a. You acknowledge that you've read, understood, and concluded a legally binding contract with us in which you agree to be bound and abide by these User Terms and any additional documents or policies referred to in these User Terms, whether you are participating as a guest or as a registered User;</li>
    <li>b. You consent to receive communications from us electronically; we will communicate with you by email or by posting notices on the Site</li>

You understand and agree that your access to or use of the Site is governed by the User Terms effective at the time of your access to or use of the Site. If we make material changes to these User Terms, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on the Site prior to the effective date of the changes. We will also indicate at the top of this page the date that revisions were last made. You should revisit these User Terms on a regular basis as revised versions will be binding on you. Any such modification will be effective upon our posting of new User Terms. You understand and agree that your continued access to or use of the Site after the effective date of modifications to the User Terms indicates your acceptance of the modifications.</p>

<p>
h. Content Standards. All Your Content and any User Content must comply with the "Content Standards" set out below in these User Terms. You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Company and its affiliates and licensors for any breach of the Content Standards. These Content Standards apply to any contributions made by Users on this Site, including Your Content and any User Content. Your Content and any User Content must in their entirety comply with all applicable national, regional, federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for any content you post or actions you take via this site and their consequences. In addition, Your Content and any User Content must not:
  <ul>
    <li>Contain any material which is defamatory, obscene, indecent, abusive, offensive, harassing, violent, hateful, inflammatory, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
    <li>Promote sexually explicit or pornographic material, violence, or discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age.</li>
    <li>Infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other intellectual property rights of any other person.</li>

  </ul>
</p>

<p>
i. We Are Not Responsible for Your Content and any User Content. Because the purpose of this Site is to empower you and we cannot review everything that is posted to the Site in advance, any content and/or opinions uploaded, expressed, or submitted to the Site, and all Site Content other than the content officially provided by Company, are solely the opinions and the responsibility of the person or entity submitting them and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of Company. We are not responsible or liable to any third-party for the content or accuracy of any materials posted by you or any other User of the Site, and you agree to bear full responsibility for the content you post to the Site. We also cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any User or third-party.
</p>

<p>
<p><strong>9. Enforcement of Terms.</strong></p>
In order to ensure that the Site is used only for its intended purpose, we have the right to:

  <ul>
    <li>Remove or refuse to post any Site Content for any or no reason. This is a decision Company will strive to make fairly, but ultimately it is a decision that is solely up to Company to make.</li>
    <li>Take any action with respect to any Site Content that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion if we believe that such Site Content violates the User Terms, including the Content Standards, infringes any intellectual property right or other right, threatens the personal safety of Users of the Site and the public, or could create liability for Company.</li>
    <li>Disclose your identity to any third-party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy. We will not do this lightly, but if we think it has the potential to facilitate a fair and just resolution of the dispute, or will protect Company from liability for which we are not responsible, we may take this step.</li>
    <li>Take appropriate legal action, including, without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Site when we determine law enforcement is the proper and appropriate means for addressing the offending use.</li>
    <li>Terminate your access to all or part of the Site for any violation of these User Terms.</li>
  </ul>

While we may attempt not to disclose material in response to overzealous or inappropriate requests, without limiting the foregoing, when we have a good faith belief that the law compels us to do so or when we think justice would be served, we may cooperate with law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of anyone posting any materials on or through the Site. Should this happen, we will attempt to provide you with notice before we disclose your personal information to requesting third-parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we believe you should have a reasonable expectation of privacy in materials you disclose through your Internet use that are not clearly intended for public dissemination. Where possible, we may attempt to defend this principle even though most jurisdictions currently take the opposite position. YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS COMPANY FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY COMPANY DURING OR AS A RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER COMPANY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.
We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this section.
</p>

<p>
<p><strong>10. Links to other Sites.</strong></p>
As is typical online, this Site and User posts may contain hyperlinks to other sites. If there are other websites and resources linked to on this Site, either by Company or by you, these links are provided only for the convenience of our Users. We have no control over the contents of those websites or resources, and therefore cannot accept responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the third-party websites linked to the Site, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the User Terms and conditions of use for such websites.
</p>

<p><strong>11.No Guarantee of Service.</strong></p>
